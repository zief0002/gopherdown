Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of
metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

In the Optional Frontmatter section comment out or delete frontmatter you don't want
For example, if you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, simply delete lines 56-57
or add a # before them to comment them out.  

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file
enclose it in a block like this.

# Introduction {-}

Welcome to the _R Markdown_ thesis template. This template is based on (and in
many places copied directly from) the [Oregon State University LaTeX
template][0] and wrapped up into Chester Ismay's [*beaverdown* package][1], but
hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used TeX
or LaTeX before.  Using _R Markdown_ will also allow you to easily keep track of
your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output
included as well.  The hope is this _R Markdown_ template gets you in the habit
of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher,
but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your
results down the road.

```{r}
# Test output
read_csv("data/flights.csv") %>%
  filter(carrier_name %in% c("Alaska Airlines Inc.", "Frontier Airlines Inc."), month <= 3) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(
    M = mean(arr_delay)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will
reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis.  The use of LaTeX in combination
with _Markdown_ is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much
less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a
Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your
thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've
written before, taxing Word's capabilities.  After working with _Markdown_ and
**R** together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting
style of choice going forward.

<!-- 
If you're still on the fence about using _R Markdown_, check out the resource
for newbies available at <https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/> or email us at
<data@reed.edu>.

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with
LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to
creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to
read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and
also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.
Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of
your results.  You'll see more on this later.

<!-- 
Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of benefits!
-->

**Who should use it?**

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex
cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document
should use _R Markdown_. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but
the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep track of and
easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index,
references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly
anyone writing a thesis project.
